ICT206 Project Proposal - "Traffic System"

A bunch of "Nodes" exist, these nodes represent different ways of changing from one road to another (Intersection, Turns, Connections, Round-abouts)

These nodes have connections to each other, these are called "roads" and represent a road. These roads have different types with different variables 
- Name (Murdoch Drive)
- Speed (5km-110km)
- Width (1-5)
- Traffic Multipler (0.0-1.0)
- Crash Percentage (0.0%-100%)

The simulation can generate anywhere from 7 days of traffic up to 5 years of traffic.
This will generate a graph and give you recommendations on what to add to the system.
The System will then generate CSV file that holds all the data for the roads.

There are buildings
- Workplaces
- Hospital
- Homes
- Shops
These buildings modify traffic at a certain time. Some buildings (Hospitals, etc) will have low traffic overall, but some buildings like Homes and Shops will generate a large amount of traffic
A low amount of certain buildings may change the way things work.
These buildings have numerous types of functionality and purpose. (Hospitals heal hurt drivers)

These maybe different types of "Cars" or "Players" which modify how bad damage or traffic is.
For example: 
- Motorbikes would have low traffic noise, but a high amount of driver fatality
- Cars will have large traffic noise, and a low amount of driver fatality.

If a crash occured, the system will generate for all cars and passengers:
- Fatalities (Deaths)
- Injuries
- Safety (No Injury, no Deaths)

// RANDOM GENERATION ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The system will read a list of names from a CSV file provided.
And it will get the type of road (Drive, Street, etc) from another CSV File
If a road of the same name exists, then it will generate a new name.
If no new name can be generated, it will add a number IE: NAME (#) TYPE.

IDs and other information will be completely generated by the program.

All different types of data will be held in a "Map" structure, different types of data will have their own (Buildings, Nodes, Connections, etc)

// CSV FORMAT //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

The road can either be randomly generated, or can be placed in via a CSV (Comma Seperated Values File)

for all roads:
ROAD_ID, ROAD_NAME, ROAD_DATA, ROAD_CONNECTIONS

for all vehicles: 
VEHICLE_ID, VEHICLE_DATA
